# House Price Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The analysis and model development are documented in the Jupyter Notebook `HousePricePrediction.ipynb`.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing regression models to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
